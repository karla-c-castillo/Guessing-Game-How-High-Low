# HW3 MGT 205 Information System UCR 

Generate a random number between 1 and 20. 
Let the user guess the number (assume the user canâ€™t see the printed number).
Tell the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
If the guess is correct, print a congratulations message (feel free to make it funny) and exit the program. 
If the guess is incorrect, let the user guess again. The user gets unlimited chances to guess.
